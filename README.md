# Burp-Vuln-Issue-ID-Extractor
This code extracts the Burp vulnerability issues together with their hex codes. This helps writing a configuration generator, that allows to generate Burp Scanner configurations for certain issues only. This is useful, because the Burp GUI makes it very cumbersome to disable vulnerabilities to check for.
